## 🔐 About Me

I am a **Web3 developer with a strong security mindset**, focused on building simple and transparent tools for the Stacks ecosystem.

My interest in cybersecurity comes from real-world experience:  
I was personally affected by the **AlexLab exploit (2024)**, which motivated me to learn **Incident Response, Blue Team practices, and risk prevention**.

I combine:
- Practical frontend development
- API integrations (Stacks ecosystem)
- Defensive security thinking
- Clear documentation and user education
