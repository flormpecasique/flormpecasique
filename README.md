## 🔐 About Me

I am a **security-focused Web3 developer and Junior Cybersecurity Analyst**, building simple tools for the Stacks ecosystem with a strong emphasis on user safety.

My interest in cybersecurity comes from real-world experience.  
I was personally affected by the **AlexLab exploit (2024)**, which motivated me to learn **Incident Response, Blue Team practices, and risk prevention**.

I enjoy combining:
- Frontend development (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
- API integrations (Stacks ecosystem)
- Defensive security thinking
- Clear documentation and user-focused design
